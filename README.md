# Regional Demographic Profile
The Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC) is the federally designated metropolitan planning organization, as well as the state-designated regional transportation planning organization, for the central Puget Sound region. PSRC is responsible for developing and regularly updating the regionâ€™s long-range transportation plan as well as distributing federal transportation funds to local projects through its transportation improvement program. In 2003, PSRC developed a baseline demographic profile as an initial step toward better integrating environmental justice into its transportation work program. That profile is updated to present current demographic data describing the central Puget Sound region each year to identify population groups and communities to be considered for subsequent environmental justice analyses and activities.

## Data
The data for the Regional Demographic Profile is pulled from a variety of tables from the latest 1-yr and 5yr American Community Survey(ACS) estimates for the four (4) counties that make up PSRC (King, Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish). The tables summarizzed in the profile are:

- Population by Race and Hispanic/Latino Origin (1yr)
- Poverty Statistics (1yr)
- Poverty Rates by Race and Hispanic/Latino Origin (5yr)
- Median Household Income by Race and Hispanic/Latino Origin of Householder (1yr)
- Poverty Rate for the Population Age 65 and Over (1yr)
- Poverty Rate for the Population Under 18 (1yr)
- Poverty Rate for Persons with a Disability (1yr)
- Households with No Vehicle (1yr PUMS data)
- Persons with Limited English Proficiency (1yr)
- Language Spoken at Home by Ability to Speak English (5yr)
- Common Languages Other Than English Spoken in the Central Puget Sound (5yr)
