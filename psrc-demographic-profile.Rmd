# Introduction
Since the mid-1990s, a renewed emphasis on environmental justice has become an integral part of the transportation planning process for urban regions in the United States. The concept of “environmental justice” is derived from Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [^1] and other civil rights statutes, and was first put forth as a national policy goal by presidential Executive Order 12898, issued in 1994, which directs “each federal agency to make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.” [^2]

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) responded to the directive with its DOT Order to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations in 1997. [^3] The order laid out the following environmental justice principles to be integrated into federal transportation programs, policies, and activities:

* To avoid, minimize, or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects, including social and economic effects, on minority and low-income populations.  
* To ensure the full and fair participation by all potentially affected communities in the transportation decision-making process.  
* To prevent the denial of, reduction in, or significant delay in the receipt of benefits by minority and low-income populations.  

The DOT issued an updated internal Order in May 2012. DOT Order 5610.2(a) continues to be a key component of the Department’s strategy to promote the principles of environmental justice in all Departmental programs, policies, and activities.

With this guidance, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) renewed their commitments to ensure that environmental justice is carried out in the programs and strategies they fund including the activities of metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs). [^4] The FHWA has specifically directed MPOs to:

* Enhance their analytical capabilities to ensure that their long-range transportation plan and their transportation improvement program comply with Title VI.
* Identify residential, employment, and transportation patterns of low-income and minority populations so that their needs can be identified and addressed, and the benefits and burdens of transportation investments can be fairly distributed.
* Evaluate and – where necessary – improve their public involvement processes to eliminate participation barriers and engage minority and low-income populations in transportation decision-making.

The <b>Puget Sound Regional Council (PSRC)</b> is the federally designated metropolitan planning organization, as well as the state-designated regional transportation planning organization, for the central Puget Sound region. 

\newpage
Under these mandates, PSRC is responsible for developing and regularly updating the region’s long-range transportation plan, the Regional Transportation Plan, [^5] as well as distributing federal transportation funds to local projects through its transportation improvement program. In 2003, PSRC developed the baseline demographic profile as an initial step toward better integrating environmental justice into its transportation work program. [^6] That profile has now been updated to present current demographic data describing the central Puget Sound region to identify population groups and communities to be considered for subsequent environmental justice analyses and activities.

# Objectives
PSRC set out to meet two primary objectives in preparing this environmental justice demographic profile:

* Compile key demographic data on minority and low-income populations in the central Puget Sound region, as well as other populations of interest, for environmental justice consideration in conducting regional transportation, economic development, and growth management planning and program activities and public outreach.
* Identify the locations of communities within the region with significant minority and low-income populations to facilitate and enhance environmental justice analyses, outreach, and other planning activities.

# Definitions
Executive Order 12898, and the DOT, FHWA, and FTA orders on environmental justice address persons belonging to any of the following groups:

## Minority Populations
* Black - a person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa. 
* American Indian and Alaskan Native - a person having origins in any of the original people of North America and who maintains cultural identification through tribal affiliation or community recognition. 
* Asian - a person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent.
* Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander – a person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.  
* Hispanic - a person of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.  

## Low Income Population
* Low-Income - a person whose household income (or in the case of a community or group, whose median household income) is at or below the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) poverty guidelines. States and localities may, however, adopt a higher threshold for low-income as long as the higher threshold is not selectively implemented and is inclusive of all persons at or below the HHS poverty guidelines.  

## Other Populations
While the various orders on environmental justice require consideration of only minority and low-income populations as defined above, discussions of other populations protected by Title VI and related nondiscrimination statutes – such as the elderly, disabled, etc. – are encouraged in addressing environmental justice and Title VI in federally sponsored transportation programs, policies, and activities.  

# Regional Data Profile Tables
Drawing from the American Community Survey, PSRC compiled data tables of key demographic statistics on the region’s minority and low-income populations and other populations and characteristics of interest for environmental justice consideration. The data tables report statistics for the central Puget Sound region as a whole as well as each of its four counties – King, Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish.

## Observations
Tables 1 and 2 provide essential statistics on the region’s minority and low-income populations. Minorities, or non-White persons including White persons of Hispanic/Latino origin, comprised **`r round(results[['shares']][['Region']][['race']][['non-white']]*100,1)` percent** of the region’s total population in `r yr`. Minorities comprised the largest share of the population in King County **(`r round(results[['shares']][['King County']][['race']][['non-white']]*100,1)` percent)**, followed by Pierce County **(`r round(results[['shares']][['Pierce County']][['race']][['non-white']]*100,1)` percent)**, Snohomish County **(`r round(results[['shares']][['Snohomish County']][['race']][['non-white']]*100,1)` percent)**, and Kitsap County **(`r round(results[['shares']][['Kitsap County']][['race']][['non-white']]*100,1)` percent)**. All groups except White alone **(down xx percent)** and American Indian and Alaska Native **(no change)** increased their share of the population since 2016, with percent of total minority growing by **xx percent** in two years.

In `r yr`, the regionwide poverty rate was **`r round(results[['shares']][['Region']][['poverty']][['under-100%']]*100,1)` percent**. The poverty rate was highest in Pierce County **(`r round(results[['shares']][['Pierce County']][['poverty']][['under-100%']]*100,1)` percent)** and lowest in Snohomish County **(`r round(results[['shares']][['Snohomish County']][['poverty']][['under-100%']]*100,1)` percent)**. Table 2 also reports statistics for the percentage of the region’s population below 150 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty level in `r yr`. These statistics indicate that there are substantial numbers of families and individuals in the region whose incomes are above the federal poverty level, but within a range that may still be considered lower income, particularly when taking into account the cost of living in the central Puget Sound region. Federal poverty thresholds are not adjusted for regional, state, and local variations in the cost of living, which is higher in the central Puget Sound region relative to most other areas of the United States on average because of higher local housing and transportation costs.  

Tables 3 and 4 illustrate the relationship between minority and low-income populations.Poverty rates are higher, and median household incomes generally lower, for minority populations compared to the White population or total population overall. While the poverty rate for the Asian population is very similar to that of the total population, for other racial and ethnic groups it can be more than double. (The total population for whom poverty is determined and the poverty rate are different between this table and Table 2 because the data are drawn from different ACS series: 5-year versus 1-year, respectively. See Appendix B. Data Notes for more details.)  

Table 4 shows the median household income by race and ethnicity as well as the ratio of those median incomes to that of all households. Asians have the highest median income for the region as well as in King County, but there is wide variation by both county and race/ethnicity. Most groups saw significant increases in median income between **xx and xx**. The largest increases in income are found among American Indians **(xx percent)**, Some Other Race **(xx percent)** and those of Hispanic ethnicity **(xx percent)**.  

Tables 5-7 present demographic statistics, including poverty rates, for the region’s elderly, youth, and disabled populations. The disabled population is shown to have significantly higher rates of poverty than the total population overall, whereas poverty rates for the elderly population are significantly lower. The rate for children under 18 is less than that for those with disabilities, generally about 2 percentage points higher than for the general population, although the difference in Pierce County is twice that in the other counties and of the region overall.  

Table 8 compares vehicle non-availability among household types. Households with a minority householder, low-income households, households with an elderly householder, and households with one or more disabled persons are more likely to have no vehicle available than the average household in the region. These data indicate that the transportation, and especially public transit, needs of such households are significantly different from the average household.

Tables 9 and 10 present statistics on persons with limited English proficiency and common languages other than English spoken in the central Puget Sound region. This information is intended to support the development of the public outreach and involvement component of PSRC’s environmental justice program.  

Finally, Table 11 lists the most commonly spoken languages at home other than English, for the region and for each county.
